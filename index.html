<p>Like method and theory, ethics are an important part of defining an academic field or discipline. Archaeology has multiple well-defined ethics' lists, including <a href="http://www.canadianarchaeology.com/caa/about/ethics">Canadian Archaeological Association's</a>. Often, however, these policies do not cover all components of Digital Arcaheology, especially in relation to increasingly prominent issues like crowdsourcing and other internet-specific phenomena. If there is no specified list of ethics, what does this mean for Digital Archaeology as a unique discipline outside of traditional archaeology?</p>
      
      <h3>Why Ethics?</h3>
      
<p>Ethics are an important part of archaeology, along with other academic disciplines, since it provides an outline and protections for any individuals and groups involved to follow. Without standardized ethical guidelines, it is left unclear what responsibilities archaeologists and other academics have, which also muddies the waters for how other groups, ideas, or even objects may be affected. Thus, there is a need for Digital Archaeology to have a set of ethical guidelines to define the discipline and make it an effective field. But does there need to be a set of ethical guidelines for Digital Archaeology that is distinct from traditional archaeology?</p>
      
      <h3>Why Digital Archaeology?</h3>
      
<p>While there are many common aims and intentions between Digital Archaeology and traditional archaeology, there is a need for a distinct set of ethical guidelines. Using the <i>Canadian Archaeological Association's Principles of Ethical Conduct</i> as an example, it is clear that there are certain aspects of Digital Archaeology that are covered, but several key dimensions that are not.</p>

      <p>As illustrated by Atkins in “Digging up the Digital Dead,”<sup>1</sup> there is a “distinct lack of guidance for digital practices in osteoarchaeology and related disciplines, especially where ethical considerations are concerned.” While many researchers and museums are adapting pre-existing policies for digital archaeology, but there is still a need for these guidelines and policies to be formally amended. Atkins notes how there has not been much consideration of ethical impacts, especially regarding the collection, dissemination, and access of data. When exploring these issues, Atkins frames much of the discussion within the context of 3D scans and prints. This type of digital archaeology is a key example of something not covered in standard archaeology ethics policies. From making these objects to displaying them, there are many ethical concerns that need to be discussed, understood, and codified.</p>
      
      <p>Another article that demonstrates the need for specific ethical policies for digital archaeology is “Human Subjects Review and Digital Archaeology” by C. Morgan.<sup>2</sup> In particular, this article explores ethical concerns related to human subjects bing explored in archaeology. Ethical concerns related to human subjects is an important part of archaeological studies, and is thus present in many codes, including the <i>CAA</i>’s and the <i>AAA</i>’s codes of professional and ethical conduct as some key examples for North America. Due to the ease with which data is able to be shared and accessed online, however, poses problems that seem to extend beyond the framework of ethical codes. The article outlines some ways in which digital data can be approached ethically, but the article nonetheless concludes on a note that clearly shows the need for more codified or specified ethical guidelines.</p>
      
      <p>Moreover, from research and collection to dissemination and access, digital archaeology is currently faced with a host of ethical issues. In order to further define digital archaeology as a specific field or discipline, there is currently a need for more well established guidelines. While codes like the <i>CAA</i> and <i>AAA</i> cover numerous important issues that can apply to certain components of the method and theory of digital archaeology, there is still a need for further types of ethical protections. As mentioned above, there issues like 3D modeling that can raise concerns regarding the nature of objects and their implications to certain groups or peoples. Additionally, processes like crowdsourcing that are specific to digital archaeology are clearly not outlined in current ethical policies.</p>
      
      <p>In short, ethics play a key role in legitimizing as well as defining a discipline, so in upcoming years it will likely become essential for Digital Archaeology to develop a well-defined code. As noted in <i>The Technology</i> section above, technological advances may lead increased amount of research and storage of data in digital space. As a result, ethical issue will likely continue to increase over time, and the longer it takes to define a distinct set of guidelines, the harder it may become as Digital Archaeology continues to expand and develop.</p>
