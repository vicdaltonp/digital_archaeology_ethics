<p>Like method and theory, ethics are an important part of defining an academic field or discipline. Archaeology has multiple well-defined ethics' lists, including <a href="http://www.canadianarchaeology.com/caa/about/ethics">Canadian Archaeological Association's</a>. Often, however, these ethics are not entirely applicable to Digital Arcaheology, especially in relation to increasingly prominent issues like crowdsourcing. If there is no specified list of ethics, what does this mean for Digital Archaeology as a unique discipline outside of traditional archaeology?</p>
      
      <h3>Why Ethics?</h3>
      
<p>Ethics are an important part of archaeology, along with other academic disciplines, since it provides an outline and protections for any individuals and groups involved to follow. Without standardized ethical guidelines, it is left unclear what responsibilities archaeologists and other academics have, which also muddies the waters for how other groups, ideas, or even objects may be affected. Thus, there is a need for Digital Archaeology to have a set of ethical guidelines to define the discipline and make it an effective field. But does there need to be a set of ethical guidelines for Digital Archaeology that is distinct from traditional archaeology?</p>
      
      <h3>Why Digital Archaeology?</h3>
      
<p>While there are many common aims and intentions between Digital Archaeology and traditional archaeology, there is a need for a distinct set of ethical guidelines. Using the <i>Canadian Archaeological Association's Principles of Ethical Conduct</i> as an example, it is clear that there are certain aspects of Digital Archaeology that are covered, but several key dimensions that are not.</p>
